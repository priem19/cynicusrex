    <h1>Pride is dumb.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Winning necessarily comes down to luck or the defeat of an inferior. Both are nothing to be proud of. Therefore, we should not compete for the sake of being better than others, but only to improve ourselves and help others do the same.</p>
    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Diogenes of Sinope to Cicermos:</h2>
    <p class="quote">[…] ‘And who’, I asked, ‘did you have for your opponents?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘The foremost men of Greece and Asia.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘And were they stronger than you, or much the same, or weaker?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘Stronger.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘You say that they were stronger, and yet they were defeated by you?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘They were of the same strength.’</p>
    <p class="quote"><strong>‘And how could you defeat people of equivalent strength unless they were weaker than you? Or are you the only person who is capable of doing that? Well? In point of fact, there is no one who doesn’t prevail over people of inferior strength.</strong> You should say farewell, then, to all of this, Cicermos, and no longer compete in the pancration, or against men to whom you will be inferior before long, when you arrive at old age. You should turn instead to things of true value, and learn to practise endurance, not under the blows of puny men, but under those of fate, and not under the blows that come from leather thongs and fists, but under those of poverty, of disrepute, of low birth, of exile. For when you have trained yourself to think light of these things, you will live a happy life and meet a tolerable death; but if you pursue them, you will live in misery.’ As I explained these things to him, he threw his palm branch to the ground, pulled the crown from his head, and had the strength to call off his journey.’ —Diogenes of Sinope (404 – 323 BC) <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>A trophy or atrophy?</h2>
    <p>Resist comparing yourself to others not only in sports, but in all aspects of life: career, wealth, fame, et cetera. <!-- It's a shitty mindset; bear with me. While a trophy and a turd consist of the same star dust, at least feces crawl with life which can fertilize beautiful organisms; we can even transplant healthy feces to those suffering from Clostridium Difficile <span class="source">()</span>. None of that can be done efficiently with a trophy, nor an -->  An expensive house, a horde of followers, or any other inanimate concepts which are given artificial prestige mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.</p>

    <p>The chase for prestige and the manifestation of similar superficial mindsets hinders living in the moment—for there's no thin line between a trophy and atrophy. It turns everything into a contest. Pan-capitalism… cancer. One can climb trees to elevate oneself, and one can climb trees to elevate oneself above another. The former is about its inherent fun, beauty, and liberation, the latter about the ability to say “I am the best.” But what good does that do? What joy is shared? Play becomes work. I argue that the activity loses purity.</p>

    <p>But, however much I would like simplifying it to one commandment: “Just play!”, I can't. For when does play turn competitive? I have a hard time grappling with this question because I too find running contests to be exhilarating and satisfying, I too <em>play</em> chess to win—an aspect inherently inextricable. Conversely, I would balk at tree climbing contest, whereas others might not, which I understand. Conundrum. Where do we go from here?</p>

    <p class="quote">“Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that <strong>Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.</strong> And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.” —Mark Twain <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>Friendly competition.</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and enjoy a friendly game of chess, rugby, or any other activity, but curb your pride when winning and reduce the excessive commodification thereof. “Hold your horses there, buddy, winning means I've worked harder than others, so I deserve praise and shiny objects.” On the surface this seems like a reasonable objection, however, it always boils down to luck both in nature and nurture <span class="source"></span>. For instance, many variables can be attributed to DNA: some people are just lucky in being taller or in being considered more attractive given their culture. Others have had more nurturing parents or teachers, and yet another group have no moral compass so they don't mind becoming successful through exploitation and deceit. Ultimately, no matter how you roll the dice, the debate ends up at free will—which doesn't exist, meaning that you're not the first cause of anything, not even your thoughts <span class="source"></span>*—another distinct contentious topic.</p>

    <p>Anyway, as Diogenes said, winning necessitates a weaker opponent, or pure luck. Victorious pride is therefore just as ridiculous as nationalism: why be proud of something you largely weren't responsible for. And regarding the commodification of sports, I consider it a symptom of a seriously flawed system that athletes whose main purpose is entertainment, advertisement, confirming “Panem et circenses”, and gambling, are paid exorbitant amounts of money, while teachers, medical professionals, cleaning personnel, who serve a significantly more important purpose, barely get by in comparison. Alas, poisonous profit motives prevail.</p>

    <h2>But, evolution?</h2>
    <p class="quote">“Without competition we'd still be single celled organisms.” —House M.D. <span class="source">()</span></p>
    <p>At first glance it sounds like an apt rebuke, but as far as we know we're the only species that have a rational mind, allowing us to scrutinize our motives. And as aforementioned, scrutiny shows that competitive pride is folly. Moreover, technology allows us to evolve without competition.</p>

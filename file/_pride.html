    <h1>Pride is dumb.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Winning necessarily comes down to luck or the defeat of an inferior. Both are nothing to be proud of. Therefore we should not compete for the sake of being better than others, but only to improve ourselves and help others do the same.</p>
    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Diogenes of Sinope to Cicermos:</h2>
    <p class="quote">[…] ‘And who’, I asked, ‘did you have for your opponents?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘The foremost men of Greece and Asia.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘And were they stronger than you, or much the same, or weaker?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘Stronger.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘You say that they were stronger, and yet they were defeated by you?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘They were of the same strength.’</p>
    <p class="quote"><strong>‘And how could you defeat people of equivalent strength unless they were weaker than you? Or are you the only person who is capable of doing that? Well? In point of fact, there is no one who doesn’t prevail over people of inferior strength.</strong> You should say farewell, then, to all of this, Cicermos, and no longer compete in the pancration, or against men to whom you will be inferior before long, when you arrive at old age. You should turn instead to things of true value, and learn to practise endurance, not under the blows of puny men, but under those of fate, and not under the blows that come from leather thongs and fists, but under those of poverty, of disrepute, of low birth, of exile. For when you have trained yourself to think light of these things, you will live a happy life and meet a tolerable death; but if you pursue them, you will live in misery.’ As I explained these things to him, he threw his palm branch to the ground, pulled the crown from his head, and had the strength to call off his journey.’ —Diogenes of Sinope (404 – 323 BC) <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>Pride is a vice, humility a virtue. </h2>
    <p>A trophy and a turd consist of the same star dust. But at least turds crawl with life which in turn fertilize beautiful organisms. One can even transplant feces to those suffering from Clostridium Difficile <span class="source">()</span>. Conversely, a trophy, or in the same vain an expensive house, a fast car, or fancy clothes are inanimate objects which are given artificial prestige that mean nothing and ultimately detract from life because materialistic mindsets turn everything into a contest.</p>

    <h2>Friendly competition.</h2>
    <p>We can still enjoy a friendly game of chess, or rugby, but stop being proud about winning, or paying athletes so much. As Diogenes said, winning necessitates a weaker opponent, or pure luck. It's just as ridiculous as nationalism: why be proud of something one had no say in?</p>

    <p>“Oh wow, hold your horses, it means I've trained better than others, so I deserve to be proud.” On the surface this seems correct, but many variables can be traced back to DNA. Some people are lucky in being taller, having had more nurturing parents, being able to learn by because of such and such, and so on. It always goes back to the free will debate—there is no free will—you're not the first cause of anything, not even your thoughts.</p>

    <h2>But, evolution?</h2>
    <p class="quote">“Without competition we'd still be single celled organisms.” —House M.D. <span class="source">()</span></p>
    <p>At first glance it sounds like an apt rebuke, but as far as we know we're the only species that have a rational mind, allowing us to scrutinize our motives. And as aforementioned, scrutiny shows that competitive pride is folly. Moreover, technology allows us to evolve without competition.</p>

    <h2>“Isn't that racist?”</h2>
    <p>No. Religion isn't a race. </p>

    <p>Also, racism is equally stupid. No one chooses their birthplace, parents, or species, so <a href="./pride.html">being proud on something you're not responsible for is folly.</a> It follows that pride in general inherently makes no sense because most of what happens can be attributed to luck <span class="source">()</span>. <!-- Just live, go vegan, and don't be an asshole. Which means teaching children about paper airplanes so they can fly instead of fear. --></p>

    <h2>“Isn't that Islamophobic?”</h2>
    <p>Yes. And in a sense that word is a dysphemism; that is, it's trying to make the thing sound worse than it is. Whereas in fact there's nothing wrong with being scared of profoundly dangerous ideas or the purveyors thereof. <!-- Religion kills more than it saves.  -->Similarly, people against war—pacifists—generally aren't slandered as “warphobists”, except for the occasional “hippy”.</p>

    <p>Why resort to dysphemisms? People feel personally attacked when their ideas get scrutinized because there lies great difficulty in separating one's ideas from one's identity. They take it personally. This isn't just a problem with religious folk, it applies to the general populace. Instead of self-reflection—questioning the validity one's thoughts—it's easier to silence opponents with slander. Dirty tactic, but unfortunately it works.</p>

    <h2>Why atheism is insufficient.</h2>
    <p>The problem already starts at the definition of atheism: “the doctrine or belief that there is no God.” <span class="source"></span>. Even though it is equally silly to believe in gods or <em>the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, why bother, for we can't prove or disprove either of them*. As long as people don't <em>act</em> on irrational convictions there is little harm in believing there are supreme beings. We can't spy on or control people's thoughts anyway. While I stand behind atheists, atheism too sparingly addresses this crux of its importance. It's not the individual belief in gods that does most harm, but the collective religious actions reliant upon the gullible but largely harmless thoughts of common folk. Baptism, communion, confession, prayer, indulgence, celibacy, stoning, female genital mutilation, witch hunting, you name it. Think of an atrocity and some religion, Christian, Muslim, will have something to do with it.</p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* If it turns out there <em>are</em> gods they're probably computer scientists who built an advanced <em>Age of Empires</em> (AoE) game. Occam's razor: the simplest explanation is usually the right one. Which sounds more likely? Omnipotent gods creating an unfathomably complex man made from DNA, only to make masturbation a sin and watch the consequences? Or a CEO deciding that childhood leukemia must remain an ingame feature because a cost-benefit analysis shows less profits if the game is less challenging, less “fun”. Given the rampant human greed, I can confidently guess which one is more likely.<!--  If it sounds like a jest about cancer patients you didn't get the point. --></p>

    <p class="quote">“Find a society that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire, Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and gone down the pits—as a result of doing that—into famine and war and dictatorship and torture and repression. That's the experiment I would like to run. I don't think that's going to end up with a gulag.” —Christopher Hitchens <span class="quote-year">(1949 – 2011)</span> <a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sD0B-X9LJjs">📺&#xFE0E;</a></p>
      
    <p class="quote">“I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.” —Thomas Paine <span class="quote-year">(1737 – 1809)</span> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6979841-i-do-not-believe-in-the-creed-professed-by-the">📚&#xFE0E;</a></p>

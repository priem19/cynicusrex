    <h2>“Isn't that racist?”</h2>
    <p>No. Religion isn't a race. </p>

    <p>Also, racism is equally stupid. No one chooses their birthplace, parents, or species, so <a href="./pride.html">being proud on something you're not responsible for is folly.</a> It follows that pride in general inherently makes no sense because most of what happens can be attributed to luck <span class="source">()</span>. <!-- Just live, go vegan, and don't be an asshole. Which means teaching children about paper airplanes so they can fly instead of fear. --></p>

    <h2>“Isn't that Islamophobic?”</h2>
    <p>Yes. And in a sense that word is a dysphemism; that is, it's trying to make the thing sound worse than it is. Whereas in fact there's nothing wrong with being scared of profoundly dangerous ideas or the purveyors thereof, e.g., Islam, Christianity. Similarly, people against war—pacifists—generally aren't slandered as “warphobists”, except for the occasional “hippy”.</p>

    <p>Why resort to dysphemisms? People feel personally attacked when their ideas get scrutinized because there lies great difficulty in separating one's ideas from one's identity. They take it personally. This isn't just a problem with religious folk, it applies to the general populace. Instead of self-reflection—questioning the validity one's thoughts—it's easier to silence opponents with slander. Dirty tactic, but unfortunately it works.</p>

    <h2>Why atheism is insufficient.</h2>
    <p>The problem already starts at the definition of atheism: “the doctrine or belief that there is no God.” <span class="source"></span>. Even though it is equally silly to believe in gods as it is to believe in <em>the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, why bother, for we can't prove or disprove either, and we can't spy on or control people's thoughts anyway. As long as people don't <em>act</em> on irrational convictions there is little harm in believing there are “supreme” beings*.</p>

    <p>Atheism too sparingly addresses the actual crux of its importance: it's not the <em>individual</em> belief in gods that does harm—though gullibility is a catalyst—instead it's the (collective) religious actions that may flow from it. As with many bad things in society, these actions are characterized by “smart” people taking advantage of the gullible, hence why religion starts at birth. There's nothing easier than to mold the mind of a defenseless impressionable child. What begins with a seemingly innocuous form of baptism and communion soon segways into prayer, i.e., scare tactics, which in turn leads to confession, i.e., medieval <em>mass</em> surveillance, resulting in a cult that practices paying for absolution, celibacy leading to rampant sexual molestation <span class="source"></span>, female genital mutilation, witch hunting, castigating homosexuality, foregoing modern medicine for faith healing, capital punishment for apostasy or being an unveiled female… et cetera. These dangerous beliefs and barbaric practices occur to this day.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.” —Voltaire <span class="quote-year">(1694 – 1778)</span></p>
  
    <!-- <p class="quote">“I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.” —Thomas Paine <span class="quote-year">(1737 – 1809)</span> <span class="source"></span></p> -->

    <p class="footnote">* If there <em>are</em> gods they're probably computer scientists who built an advanced <em>Age of Empires</em> game. Occam's razor: the simplest explanation is usually the right one. Which sounds more likely? Omnipotent gods creating an unfathomably complex man made from DNA, only to make masturbation a sin and watch the consequences? Or a CEO deciding that childhood leukemia must remain an ingame feature because the cost-benefit analysis projects less profits if the game is less challenging, less “fun”. Given we're still afflicted with rampant human greed, I can confidently guess which one is more likely.<!--  If it sounds like a jest about cancer patients you didn't get the point. --></p>

    <h2>Antireligion.</h2>
    <p>Since religion necessitates the indoctrination of children and suppression of rational thought, it is evil. Religion should only be thought in history books. All of it. Good and evil. And if individuals of a ripe age still come to decide they want to be religious, let them. However, these will be few, for it is no match against history and philosophy.</a></p>

    <p class="quote">“Find a society that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire, Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and gone down the pits—as a result of doing that—into famine and war and dictatorship and torture and repression. That's the experiment I would like to run. I don't think that's going to end up with a gulag.” —Christopher Hitchens <span class="quote-year">(1949 – 2011)</span> <span class="source"></span></p>

    <p>There is one redeeming factor that prevents me from throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Religious morals and ethics? No. While religion does contain a decent set of aphorisms, philosophy does it better, and <em>includes</em> logic. Moreover, scripture is vague. While I was delighted to hear about “Riba: a concept in Islam that refers broadly to the concept of growth, increasing, or exceeding, which in turn forbids interest credited from loans or deposits.” <span class="source"></span> it always crumbles due to the following flaw: “While Muslims agree that riba is prohibited, not all agree on what precisely it is.” <span class="source"></span> I.e., if something is considered haram by scholar A, one can simply find a scholar B who considers it halal.</p>

    <p>Tangent time, homosexuality. While conversing with a Muslim colleague I learned that even though the religious supposedly say they want tolerance and acceptance for all, they don't actually believe it. Q: “Do you have a problem with homosexuality?” A: “Look. They can do whatever they want, but it's abnormal you see?” Q: “In the strict definition of the word abnormal I agree, i.e., heterosexuality is a lot more prevalent than homosexuality, making the latter rare—abnormal. But I don't consider it wrong. Do you? Do you consider it a sin? Even though it harms no one?” Some moments pass… “Yes, I consider it a sin.” Q: “Okay then.” <br> With that backwardness out of the way, the major strength of religion is community. Community, brotherhood, loyalty, oneness is sorely lacking in secular societies. “God created mankind in his own image” <span class="source"></span>, whereas mankind created god in himself, the individual. <a href="./play.html">Each on his own island.</a> Instead of churches we have shopping malls. Instead of temperance we have glut. Instead of altruism we have greed. Religion poisons everything <span class="source"></span>, but so does money, and money has become our god.</p>

    <h2>The solution.</h2>
    <p>With childlike simplicity: take the good from both and discard the bad. Just as we should in politics. Rise above the ego, detach your ideas from your identity.</p>

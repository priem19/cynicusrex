    <h1>The boons and banes of being spoiled.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">I've never <em>had</em> to work, which has it's ups and downs. It's only after losing something that you realize its value. In my case, every time a firetruck passes, remorse sets in; I shouldn't have quit.</p>

    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>At age 31, dealing with the fallout of Covid-19, I've come to realize the up- and downsides of being spoiled. Materially spoiled, because poor was my intellectual or emotional upbringing. Many would call me ignorant, not realizing how lucky I was with the chances I got, which is true to a degree, but not the whole story.</p>

    <p class="quote">“They couldn't give me a lot of material things, but they gave me morals, courage, and most important of all, love.” —Philip Banks</p>

    <p>My parents meant the best, my situation was the opposite.</p>

    <h2>Quitting.</h2>
    <p>My biggest flaw and regret: serial quitting. </p>

    <h2>Diogenes of Sinope to Cicermos:</h2>
    <p class="quote">[…] ‘And who’, I asked, ‘did you have for your opponents?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘The foremost men of Greece and Asia.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘And were they stronger than you, or much the same, or weaker?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘Stronger.’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘You say that they were stronger, and yet they were defeated by you?’</p>
    <p class="quote">‘They were of the same strength.’</p>
    <p class="quote"><strong>‘And how could you defeat people of equivalent strength unless they were weaker than you? Or are you the only person who is capable of doing that? Well? In point of fact, there is no one who doesn’t prevail over people of inferior strength.</strong> You should say farewell, then, to all of this, Cicermos, and no longer compete in the pancration, or against men to whom you will be inferior before long, when you arrive at old age. You should turn instead to things of true value, and learn to practise endurance, not under the blows of puny men, but under those of fate, and not under the blows that come from leather thongs and fists, but under those of poverty, of disrepute, of low birth, of exile. For when you have trained yourself to think light of these things, you will live a happy life and meet a tolerable death; but if you pursue them, you will live in misery.’ As I explained these things to him, he threw his palm branch to the ground, pulled the crown from his head, and had the strength to call off his journey.’ —Diogenes of Sinope (404 – 323 BC) <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>A trophy or atrophy?</h2>
    <p>Resist comparing yourself to others not only in sports, but in all aspects of life: career, wealth, fame, et cetera. <!-- It's a shitty mindset; bear with me. While a trophy and a turd consist of the same star dust, at least feces crawl with life which can fertilize beautiful organisms; we can even transplant healthy feces to those suffering from Clostridium Difficile <span class="source">()</span>. None of that can be done efficiently with a trophy, nor an -->  An expensive house, a horde of followers, or any other inanimate concepts which are given artificial prestige mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.</p>

    <p>The chase for prestige hinders living in the moment, for such superficial mindsets turn everything into a contest. One can climb trees to elevate oneself, and one can climb trees to elevate oneself above another. The former is about its inherent fun, beauty, and liberation, the latter about the ability to say “I am the best.” But what good does that do? What joy is shared? Play becomes work. The activity loses purity. But, however much I would like to simplify it to one commandment: “Just play!”, I can't. For when does play turn competitive? I have a hard time grappling with this question because I too find running contests to be exhilarating and satisfying, I too <em>play</em> chess to win—an aspect inherently inextricable. Conundrum. Where do we go from here?</p>

    <p class="quote">“Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that <strong>Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.</strong> And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.” —Mark Twain <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>Friendly competition.</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and enjoy a friendly game of chess or rugby and whatnot, but curb your pride when winning and reduce the excessive commodification thereof. “Hold your horses there, buddy, winning means I've worked harder than others, so I deserve praise and shiny objects.” On the surface this seems like a reasonable objection, however, it always boils down to luck both in nature and nurture <span class="source"></span>. For instance, many variables can be attributed to DNA: some people are just lucky in being taller or in being considered more attractive given their culture. Others have had more nurturing parents or teachers, and yet another group lack a moral compass so they don't mind becoming successful through exploitation or deceit. There are many more examples, but no matter how you roll the dice, the debate ultimately ends up at free will, which doesn't exist. We are not the first cause of anything, not even our thoughts <span class="source"></span>*—another distinct contentious topic. </p>

    <p>Case in point, you will not choose the next word that comes to your mind, nor the next, not even the next one after, ad infinitum. Words just pop into our minds, we never choose which ones. Therefore, if we don't choose our thoughts we're not the first cause of anything. One may have kicked the pebble causing it to move, but the decision to do so was mere happenstance; you did not choose to think “kick the pebble”. It merely appeared. Things just happen and free will is an illusion making us think we're in control. Many find this realization disconcerting, but it needn't be. “Hold on, if there's no free will, why then don't people just start killing everyone?” Where does this needlessly morbid reasoning come from so often? Why would free will be the reason stopping us from murder? Instead, we could equally easily say: “If there's no free will, why don't we just help everyone?” Anyway, many dislike the idea of no free will because it robs them of the only reason by which they can convince themselves that they deserve their pride and riches; thinking they are the prime factor responsible for their success. Unfortunately for them, the variables that cause some to work harder than others is out of their hands. <!-- As Diogenes said, winning necessitates a weaker opponent, or luck. -->Victorious pride is therefore just as ridiculous as nationalism: why be proud of something you largely weren't responsible for.</p>

    <p>Regarding the commodification of athleticism; and nearly everything else for that matter <span class="source"></span>. A system is gravely flawed if athletes—whose main purpose is advertisement, gambling, and entertainment, i.e., “panem et circenses” <span class="source"></span>—are paid exorbitant amounts of money, while teachers, medical professionals, and cleaning personnel who serve a significantly more important purpose, barely get by in comparison. Yeah yeah, supply and demand and all that. Well maybe, just maybe that way of valuing <em>everything</em> is profoundly unethical. Just as slavery went from being normal to despicable not so long ago, perhaps we should do away with pan-capitalism as well, lest poisonous profit motives destroy us. While having raised millions from poverty, it has downtrodden millions into reaching for antidepressants, alcohol, consumerism, and other desperate escape mechanisms. The rat race is not worth competing in. Not only that, what's the point of material abundance when our endless quest for growth is destroying humanity's only habitable environment: “MIT Predicted in 1972 that society will collapse this century. New research shows we’re on schedule.” <span class="source"></span> Screw that. To prevent life in The Matrix becoming our reality <span class="source"></span> we need to surround ourselves with nature in all its glory. Radical reforestation! Ecomodernism! Solarpunk!</p>

    <h2>What about evolution?</h2>
    <p class="quote">“Without competition we'd still be single celled organisms.” —House M.D. <span class="source">()</span></p>
    <p>True. But as far as we know we're the only species able to scrutinize our motives and ask the question: “Haven't we evolved enough?” Well, haven't we? Given the sorry state of humanity we're in dire need of natural collaboration instead of artificial competition. Healthy organisms generally grow in equilibrium with their surroundings. Except for us humans, despite having evolved “rational” minds. Although having plenty to survive many times over—to the point we need to throw food away—we seem to have an indomitable appetite*, especially white Westerners. Consequently the wealth gap is increasing evermore. We are needlessly competing against one another in an out of control capitalist rat race. The rich bathe in luxury because of artificial scarcity.</p>

    <p>By artificial scarcity I encompass planned obsolescence, advertising, fashion, hoarding, et cetera. Many of today's products could be made to last a lifetime, but they aren't because that's not profitable. Hence why fashion has us chasing new clothes indefinitely. Hence why the supply of diamonds is being withheld because they would otherwise be worthless given their abundance. Hence why Apple opposes the right-to-repair so we buy new phones. Simultaneously our consumerist society has us compare these trinkets with one another: “My friend has the newest iPhone so I want one too.” An utterly despicable state of affairs. This soul crushing system should be disrupted because we've gotten to the point that science and technology can allow everyone to survive and thrive without competition. <!-- Sooner or later we'll probably be genetically modifying ourselves and our offspring. Which of course will bring its own set of ethical dilemmas. --></p>

    <h2>Having no ambition is a virtue.</h2>
    <p>I've always been attracted to The Shire in Lord of the Rings. A life primarily consisting of tending one's garden, raising a family, going for a stroll in nature, and that's it.</p>

    <p class="quote">“If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.”
      —Marcus Tullius Cicero
    </p>

    <p>Obviously we can't roll back technology, nor should we if we could. Surgery, telescopes, mass producing books are all supremely wonderful. It just sucks that medical professionals also have to waste their time on uninteresting self-inflicted illnesses such as obesity and lung cancer. But who can blame the poor schmucks considering there's no free will. Moreover, this state of affairs isn't so surprising considering a public education system that primarily exists to mold obedient workers instead of nourishing our natural state of curious wise scholars.</p>

    <p>Let's start doing things differently.</p>

    <h2>2021.</h2>
    <h3><a href="./note/music.html">Favourite music.</a></h3>
    <p>Music is the language of the soul. I believe one can truly know someone by learning their musical taste. Also, given the vast amount of absolutely wonderful pieces and our limited lifetime, I consider it a vice and a mark of poor intellect to listen to cheap superficial <del>songs</del> noise.</p>
    
    <h2>Archive.</h2>
    <h3><a href="./note/reddit.html">Reddit archive.</a></h3>
    <p>An archive of (my) reddit comments that are worth something to me; in case I delete my accounts on these increasingly unethical websites.</p>

    <h3><a href="./note/quora.html">Quora archive.</a></h3>
    <p>I used to be a frequent user of Quora, but deleted my account when it became hard to distinguish genuine from advertised content.</p>
